TASK: Explain how to connect integrations when they are missing or disconnected.

OBJECTIVE: Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for connecting Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, or other integrations. Do NOT pretend any integration is connected. Use ONLY the integration status from the context envelope.

OUTPUT: Plain text. No JSON schema. Write in a helpful, direct tone.

KEY POINTS TO COVER:
- Go to the Manage tab in the app
- Tap the integration (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, etc.) to start OAuth
- Complete the authorization flow in the browser
- Return to the app; the integration will show as connected
- Pull to refresh on the Brief tab to sync data

If the user has already connected but data is stale, suggest pulling to refresh on the Brief tab.

Never claim an integration is connected when it is not. Never invent connection status.
